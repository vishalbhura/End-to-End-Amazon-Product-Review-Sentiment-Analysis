# Sentiment Analysis of Amazon Reviews üõíüìùüìä

## Overview

This project focuses on sentiment analysis using machine learning and natural language processing techniques. The goal is to develop a Streamlit app capable of analyzing sentiments in various scenarios, including single-line reviews, multiple reviews from CSV files, and product reviews from Amazon URLs.

## Dataset Used

The Amazon reviews full score dataset is constructed by randomly taking 6,00,000 training samples and 1,30,000 testing samples for each review score from 1 to 5. In total there are 30,00,000 training samples and 6,50,000 testing samples.
