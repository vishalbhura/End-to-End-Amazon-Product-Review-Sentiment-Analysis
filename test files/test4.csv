"I bought this to slim down my tummy under a bridesmaid dress. First, it smelled horrific and still stunk like rubber after washing. Second, it did almost nothing to slim me down, even though I bought the suggested size. Third, after about a half hour of wearing it, it was absorbing sweat and making me feel clammy and uncomfortable. It was extremely uncomfortable to sit down in, and the boning showed through the relatively thick cotton of the dress. I abandoned it completely and felt much better."
"This product sucks!It doesn't completely suck... the 2 days I was able to wear it before the boning snapped in half it did compress pretty tight. As many people have noted, it is HELL to get into this the first time.I liked that this wasn't a body suit and the rubber on the outside would keep my shirt from sliding up.BUTThis garment:1) Rides up- if you move a lot it will eventually slide up your waist2) Leaves a huge crease on the skin above your waist-- and it hurts3) Makes you look like a sausage when you sit down: visually divides your belly in half when you sitAs I said I only wore this twice, first time I wore it for about half hour and the second time I had worn it for several hours when the boning snapped in half and was poking into my side (ouch!! )RETURNING THIS!!!"
"When I ordered this I thought it would allow me to wear some clothes that I haven't been able to do in a while because of my weight gain.I am a woman who has size 40D in breasts so I wear a large in tops and I wear a size 8 in pants, and weight 140lbs. It is suppose to clinch your waist and give you a nice looking figure. Well, it did hug my waist, but it also gave my a muffin top. Not a shape a woman wants to have. I looked better without wearing it. It folds into your folds creating a bigger fold at the top of your body. I would say this item is more for the extremely skinny female who has small breasts', no hips, or ass. Not for a woman who has large breast, hips, and ass. Not for women who are going through post-pregnancy either. For a product thats is suppose to make you feel good about yourself, it failed."
"This product is OK. The ideal behind it is great, but in my case it needs to be longer I think. I'm not tall about 5'6"" & weight about 155. After I get it on there is a roll between the bottom of my bra and the top of the waist cincher. It would be alright if your shirt isn't very snug, but isn't that the whole purpose of the waist cincher, to be able to wear jeans, shirts & dresses that are a little close fitting. It does help with the hang over with the lower cut jeans. Its just hard to wear a tight fitting shirt with them. Other than that it works pretty good. Would like to try the squeem vest to eliminate the roll between bra & waist cincher."
"I like this product. I suffer from chronic love handles especially when I wear jeans. I am 5'1"" and 122 pounds. I bought a medium because I tried my friend's small and it was way too tight for me. The medium fits well. It does get a bit hot. I love the way it hides my love handles."
"The squeem is a great idea but the construction is not the best. While the product compresses your stomach, the inner metal spines bend and then protrude at the ends. I have had to sew the ends repeatedly but the spines keep poking through. At one point, the spine developed some sort of crack and when it poked through the bottom, it scraped my stomach and I took it off immediately. I have never washed the product in the washing machine...I have always handwashed it. So, the manufacturer can't say that I didn't take good care of it."
"I only just started wearing this today but already I know I'm going to be wearing it daily, and without discomfort. I'm 6 weeks postpartum and really needed something to help me shrink back down to my former size and I do believe this WILL do the trick.So far, the hype is true. It doesn't roll down on the edges and it really evens out the figure very nicely - even under clothes you can't tell you are wearing this. I guess a con would be that I can see how you'd get sweaty wearing this all day long and especially in hot weather.Overall, I am impressed so far."
This item is very sturdy and holds in the belly area better than another softer belt I have. The measurements seem true to size and there are two rows of hooks so you can adjust if you lose some weight.The only negative points are that the item smells badly of rubber when new. It must be washed before wearing. The other is that all that rubber can make you sweat. But those are minor complaints if you want to look good for an evening. The belt also helps me sit straight so I think it's good for the back as well as the front.
I bought this product because it promised to help improve bad posture and it does. Even when I am not wearing it I find myself sitting more erect than I used to. I love it!
"the first day,( 8 hours wearing it ) it hurt me so bad , my skin was torned, itched, swell, deep red. I tried to wear other side, after few hours, I got deep burned both on the right and left belly, the skin was torned, swell, bleeding, lot of cross cut on the skin, itched for a week until now. It looked like I was beaten up or have skin disease...I am scared to dead when I look at it now. I don't know why I got it , I used something like this before, but I didn't get any bad thing. or the rubber hurt me ?"
My wife loves it but we unfortunately perchaced the wrong size. She made a coment about the sizing chart being in dress sizes and she picked the size she is and we received it and the apparel was way too small. We have been meaning to exchange it but its tough to get time being as we have new born twins. That's why she wanted the apparel. She was really excited to receive the part and was disappointed when it didn't fit.
"I went back and forth over whether or not I should purchase a small or a medium. My waist measured at 30"" just right there on the cusp. I ended up ordering the small and had the hardest time getting the booger on! And oh man UNCOMFORTABLE! Yes, it cinched my waist, but the areas that weren't inside the squeem bulged out grossly e.g. above the squeem, had a nice fat roll below my bra, not attractive and could not be hidden. I looked like a nightmare in clothes. I also didn't like that it didn't cinch my hips, meaning my pants didn't fit any better. It did make my waist tiny and gave me an hourglass figure, which I have never had before. In the long run it's getting returned. It just didn't give me the silhouette I wanted, and I don't think any amount of wearing it is going to do that."
"This product was not what I expected so I returned it. Too tight, sizing was misleading. I'll stick with my Spanx."
"This is a very heavy cotton, almost too thick. It is strpped blue just like the picture. I was thinking the picure was just another style and the one ordered would be poka dots since that is the title. I have a little girl so the blue stipes don't go. You are ordering the exact picture above so no dots!!"
The picture looks like a burnt warm orange but these are Bright orange. I really don't like the color but too much trouble to return.
wish the product description had included where it was made. it was made in china. it is a well made product.
This movie was horrible. It did not play right when I was watching it online. I liked how it went by old vampire styles. Such as crosses worked and you had to invite them in and such. But the ending was really bad. Do not waste your money on this one. Also the storyline did not really make much sense.
"This is a good puzzle-but you have to put the pieces in correctly or they don't fit well. I work with kids who have autism and this frustrates them sometimes. Otherwise, it is very durable and I use it a lot."
"Rhapsody in blue is a cool song, i guess. i'm listening to the song right now for the first time. it's cool. ,e sp driml"
"Edge of Danger is a step above a number of recent Jack Higgins tales. The protaginist - Sean Dillon, must track down a dangerous Middle Eastern billionaire before he can reek havoc on the world. While prior to 11 September, this book is relevant to our crisis. Higgins does a nice job bringing out more dimensions of Dillon and some of the other good guys. The author bumbles a chance to knock off a key character - losing the opportunity to add some tension and passion to the survivors. Incredibly, this person takes three bullets and lives. The plot is solid and fast paced. My only problem is with the enemies. They are too cold and their motives are weak. The key assaisin could audition for the Key Stone Cops. Don't get me wrong, the Edge of Danger is a good yarn. I hope Higgins continues to improve the depth and reality of his characters. I look forward to the next edition."
"This is my very first book review. Because this book is so fundamentally wrong I need to speak up. The main character Sean Dillion, formal IRA, has a license to kill and make the killing like a game rather than justice. He does whatever he wants to do without follow orders nor has any boundary. He pickup a couple of his terrorism/criminal partners making killing like a habits, terrorism competition, fun game and egoism fulfillment. It so far from any common sense such as the British General could not control this maniacal killer and let he kills who he wish to kill or threaten his masculinity. The killings like a joke to him and have absolutely no legal consequence. This book has promote violence behavior has no artist nor entertainment value. I lost my interest in Jack Higgins Sean Dillion's serial after finishing this ridicules book."
I was a big fan of Jack Higgins adventures until this book! I think this book reads like a poorly written condensed version of a good story - or like the outline of a book. It jumped around too abruptly with poorly written dialogue - no conversation was stretched into a normal length of exchange between people. It was difficult to keep track of all the minor characters in the book because none of them were well developed. I will proabably never read another Jack Higgins book. I am very disappointed - just like I got with Robert Ludlum in one of his later novels. I have never read another book of his either.
"Look. I can't really disagree with the other reviews. However, I enjoyed this book. If you, as have I, read every Sean Dillon book in the series you will enjoy spending a few hours with these characters who have become so familiar after so many years. Great literature? Not a chance. A good read for fans of Jack Higgins? Definitely!!!!"
It's got a nice warm scent of vanilla-like smell. Texture is creamy. Meadow Sweet is a nice nude color. Can't apply too much or else it'll look a bit dry.
Only has limited access to OBDII data stream unless you pay more money to upgrade the software.
Written in old English. It was very hard to read as I had to think through most sentences to figure out what was being said.
Thought I was getting a book received book on tape. a little deceiving. Rather than that the process went as expected. If it had been what we wanted would have been great.
this book was recommend 2 me from my neighbor. but i dont think that dis is dat gud of a book 2 recommend... i didnt like it 2 much but...
"I believe that this is a fantastic book for those who have more distinguished tastes. As for others, it is a slow read with challenging vocabulary."
I always liked this book. The kindle version is kind of difficult to navigate but it does its purpose. I can still go back to my last read without any problem.
"Hawthorne wrote a masterful work of historical fiction incorporating an examination of guilt, revenge and suffering in the context of Puritan Salem. Here is a book that speaks to any age about timeless themes. The Scarlet Letter is one of those books that may have force fed to one during grade school but revisited from the perspective of adulthood it is a very fine example of great writing from a true American master."
"I was quite pleased with the condition of this book, as well as it's hardcover, and the footnotes, definitions, and reading reviews for beginner readers of the genre. I am, of course, a huge fan of the Scarlet Letter itself and this copy served its purpose well. One of the few disappointments was that the color of the cover seems to look a little more coral, or pink, than scarlet or red. Also, the back cover is white, and I am most definitely one for appearances. I would have like a slightly more classic looking cover. Nonetheless, the binding will look fair on my bookshelf. Over all the book was clean and well taken care of, and was shipped to me with great haste; A Good Buy."
I know this is a classic but I just could not get into the story. Thought I would try electronic books but I need the paper feel when reading.
"I did not read much of this book, however, I do remember some of it. Often when I discuss comparative literature, I tend to use the example of Charlse Dickens's ""A Tale of Two Cities"", for in Dickens's famous novel, there are about five hundred pages of mere background information. And so, we have the style of Nathaniel Hawthorne presented to us: he is, in essence, a lover of symbolism and all things literarily analyzed. I really got into the story when the first pyre scene happened... Now, note, when I said pyre I meant pillar, for pyres are something entirely different and generally greek/medieval... Anyway, as I was saying, Hawthorned loves literary symbolism and creativity. I love the way he ended the plot, but I think that the story line could have moved a little faster, thus giving ""The Scarlet Letter"" a Dickens-like quality."
"I had to read The Scarlett Letter for my honors english 3 class. I found that the author was too verbose in describing people, places, situations, and just the story in general. The book was so wordy, I often found myself forgetting the topic of that particular paragraph. Also, I was disturbed to find out that ever day the Reverand A. Dimmesdale would beat himself, and stay up till the early morning hours!"
"I read this ""Classic"" novel for a class, and must admit I was thoroughly disappointed. Hawthorne should have stuck to writing non-fictional books about the Puritan settlers. This book was a pill. There are so many American authors, and novels that could be taught in schools that could far exceed the entertainment level of this out of date story. Two thumbs down."
"I am not one who enjoys romance, however Hawthorne's Scarlet Letter is truely an unshakable landmark in American Literature. Unlike most people, I read this novel in college (I don't know why junior high teaches this book; it's way to advanced for that intensity of reading) and depicted it as a soap opera in Puritan society. The novel inhibits sex, suspense, drama, and romance all in one pakage. I found the invidious Roger Chillingwoth to be an extremely interesting aspect about the novel's well-rounded plot. The theme of the novel is sin, and how tragically easy it could destroy a normal town denizen. I mean, all 3 main characters are virtually consumed and eventually destroyed by their own private sins. Read this book; by doing so, one will appreciate truly powerful literature that still shakes our foundation today."
i liked good book from the past....great that we can look back on these great books and enjoy them .
