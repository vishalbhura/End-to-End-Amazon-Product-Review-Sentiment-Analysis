"The Scarlet Letter shows Nathaniel Hawthorne at his finest. The imagery is quite wonderful, but there's only so many times you can say the same thing. The images in this novel stretch out far longer than needed.I nearly couldn't make it through. I do like to see every detail given it's fullest attention but even this is too much.This book is one that is very vivid and quite pleasing to understand, but hard to read and not as easy to follow. Sometimes there's only one resourceful fact in a half a page paragraph.Recommended."
Thie book isnt terrible I had to read it for my AP English class and so far it has been the easiest read. I would recommend it to anyone who likes books of that time frame.. The language uses a lot of thee's and thou's
i couldn't listen to this book because the women reading it has such a screechy horrible voice so i can give no review of the actual book but whatever you do try to find a version with a different reader if you're into audio books
"I've always wanted to read this and when I got the chance, I was a bit disappointed. The language was difficult for me to grasp and there were few scenes that I understood what was going on. After reading this, I don't understand why it is a classic. Although the message of the book was clear, the Shakespeareian-style writing was hard for me to understand."
"I finally got around to reading this classic work last year and was quite disappointed. I tend to limit my reading these days to two primary realms, classic literature and early 20th Century fiction, and this one just didn't measure up to the standard set by other famous authors of Hawthorne's day.It's a simple story about scandal and I guess I was expecting so much more. I wish I could say it was superbly-written but I think that it reflects a lack of committed effort on Hawthorne's part."
"I liked this book as I was reading it. It was really interesting to see Puritan life through Hester Prynne's eyes. I think one reason that I liked it has to do with the fact that I skipped reading the first part, ""The Custom House."" I didn't read it when the teacher told the class to read it, and I wrote a paper on it and got an A.All in all, a good book, but I don't think I would've gotten through more than half of it if I hadn't been pushed into it by my English class. Looking back, though, I'm glad I read it because a lot of other works have some thing(s) in common with ""The Scarlet Letter,"" and it would be a shame to graduate with a degree in English without reading it."
"I will never understand why they force this book on school children, I'm sure there are many other ""classic"" stories that could be included in the curriculum."
Well I read this book and it amazed me. The first time I read this book I thought it was stupid. page after page it got better. Well this book is about a girl who commits an adultery. The girl's name is Hester. So she gets an A on her dress and she goes to prison. Her husband left her like a coward. and I don't want to ruin the story so I will recomend this book to anyone who wants a good read. When I read this book i thought it was hard comepare to the books LORD OF THE FILES and THE ANIMAL FARM. so just read THE SCARLET LETTER.
"Hawthorne has written a book deeply in psychological symbolism and wordy sentences. This book is for those with enough patience to let a deluded, complex story develop -- not a story for me, even though I have read many in the genre."
"The best book that I have ever been assigned to read for school by far. The way in which Hawthorne captures the shame that Hetser , the wearer of the scarlet letter, feels everyday and the utter torment that the weak Dimmesdale is in by not coming forth and saying he slept with Hester and the revenge ridden character of Chillingworth is spectactular.The way in which Hawthorne describes the setting and the actions that characters do is truly outstanding. Hawthorne has a huge flare for the dramatic which is great for the reader. Since Hester the main character concieved her daughter Pearl through an affair she has been snetenced to wear the scarlet A on her chest for the rest of her life. The story starts on the day Hester is to stand infront of the town and wear her badge of shame and all the drama in the small puritanical town of Boston starts from there. A must read for any American."
"I, as a 10th grade student, had to read The Scarlet Letter for school. at first, what came to mind was ""this is going to be the most boring, hard to read book ever, as most school books are."" I started reading it and my nightmares were coming true. i didn't understand half of what Hawthorne was trying to say. this really put me down but once we started discussing the chapters that we had read, i realized what it was about and how good it actually is. Once i knew more about the story, reading became much easier. (some parts, though were just plain tedious.) the imagry that was used was amazing and the plot was excelent. i would have given more stars but some of it was just too complicated and i couldn't follow it.Bottom line: everyone should read this book because it is a classic for a reason. (it really is a good book) but you might want to get a guide to it or maybe cliffnotes so it is esier to understand."
"No, I'm not talking about Hester's crime. I'm talking about this STUPID BOOK! If only Hawthorne had kept his job in the customs house (see prologue), this abomination would never have been spawned from the cess-ridden depths of Hawthorne's twisted thinking organ. (You can figure THAT out on your own). This book is untolerably boring (the only proven cure of insomnia - if you don't mind the side effects) and the descriptions are ridiculously entangling. In the words of Mr. Hawthorne himself, this book is ""ignominiously"" dull. PRESERVE YOUR SANITY! NEVER READ THIS! NEVER!I sleep now..."
"If you can read and readily understand old-english, you *may* be able to enjoy this novel.I found it painfully long and didn't even care to finish it, which is unheard of for me!"
"It shocks me that the Scarlet Letter is the most taught book in the nation. It may have much symbolism and so on, but it is a convoluted mess. The author is completely detached from his audience, and for some bizarre reason, he feels he has to explain every little thing that happens in great detail. It is also irrelevant to our modern times. In our days people need to be reading things like Huxley, Orwell, Fitzgerald, Bradbury, Hemmingway, Steinbeck, Salinger, and many other great 20th century writers. This book is only relevant to those interested in the time period which it discusses."
"Quick read because the book is really a short story and some of the character language can be annoying but necessary per the theme of the novel . Interesting read especially since the book was written in the late 1800s but set in our future. Not your typical ""end of the world"" novel with all the ""glitter"" and multiple story lines like Earth Abides (same genre) but for being written so long ago the author hit the nail on the head per the cascading long-term effects of a ""Scarlet"" event."
a classic book where there is really nothing bad to say about. AS an adult though one can appreciate it more because we choose to read the book instead of it being an assignment that needs to be completed for school.
"I had to read this book, which I had heard quite a bit about, for school but after reading it I had no idea why it is considered such a classic. There is no question that the language is old-fashioned and difficult, but that isn't the only problem I found with it. The whole story was rather boring. It seemed that the author tried to make a lightweight story about an affair and the child that was a product of it deeper or more important by describing how the characters felt. The book was not exactly bad, but, like many other books, it does not really deserve its status as a classic. I saw it more as a book that showed somewhat the morals and ideas of the Puritans. While it is good in that sense, I don't think that it is very important in modern times, and it certainly wasn't a fun read."
"This book was purchased for my daughter for a class. I remember reading it in high school and yeap, still almost as drawn out as it was back then. We both think the same thing. But, a good read nonetheless."
"A classic? Hardly. In it's time this book may have ruffled feathers but these days it's a struggle to get through. Hawthorne's writing style is dreary and dreadful; if captivating readers was his aim, he failed miserably."
"The whole time reading The Scarlet Letter I thought that it was just extremely interesting. The characters were well-developed and at times, endearing. The way that Hawthorne is able to describe the torture that Reverend Dimmesdale undergoes is very believable. Although I am only thirteen years old and have never committed adultery, I find it easy to relate to Hester Prynne. And Pearl, my most favorite of all the characters, just adds a very interesting touch to the story. Despite the good characters, I did not like the fact that during most of the book, parts of the main plot are dismissed for chapters at a time to describe something not always commpletely relevent to the story. But, overall, I thought this book was very interesting, and would definately take the time to read it."
"I used to live in Hawaii. Plumerias were abundant, both growing and leis. I was excited to have that scent again in a lotion. The lotion itself is your average body lotion consistency. However, there is NO way that this is a true plumeria scent. I would not order their other ""Plumeria"" products (which are more expensive)based on this lotion."
"This is IMHO the best of the 4 Killer Tomato flicks. We even get to see Gary Condit briefly (from the back) in the pizza parlor fight scene!Without spoiling the surprises, I'll just say that the movie features a very sexy tomato who was once a real tomato."
"Return of the Killer Tomatoes is hilarious. Anthony Starke is great. J. Stephen ""Rock"" Peace is back as Lt. Wilbur Finletter. This is the best movie in the Killer Tomato Triolgy."
"As good as this book may be, the print quality is so bad that I cannot read it. Zero stars would have been more appropriate."
"All of the screws need to be double-nutted to keep them from backing out due to vibration. Replacement lamps are difficult to find, my husband ended up using 12v marker lamps from an auto parts store. Eats sidewalls for breakfast on skinny-tired bikes. A piece of 3/4"" air hose slipped over the wheel makes it able to run on the rim instead.The rear light is made to mount to a fender, FYI."
IF YOU NEED A GOOD LAUGH THIS IS THE ONE. I DON'T LIKE ANIMATED MOVIES BUT THIS IS SOOOOOOO FUNNY. THE CHARACTERS AND HUMOR CAN'T MAKE YOU FEEL SAD AT ALL. A GOOD FLICK AFTER A TOUGH DAY AT THE OFFICE.
"Just cuz it's a cartoon, and about the holiday's, does not make it a family movie. The movie was everything I expected, no real surprises. That said I do not feel the adult content shuold be used to grade the movie. My kids will not be seeing this for some time. My copy has PG-13 PARENTS STRONGLY CAUTIONED clearly stated on the back."
"The early success of Adam Sandler's films gave him this mistaken impression that he was an actor and a writer. This film proves he is neither - and a grating voice-over guy to boot. I enjoyed Happy Gilmore and to a much lesser degree, Little Nicky and Big Daddy. But Sandler is a one-trick pony. We've all seen the trick, so it's just not interesting anymore. I thought this might be the one Hanukah film in a world of X-mas fare. It has nothing to do with the holiday and is definitely not for kids."
"I went to my sisters boyfriends house, and his roomate bought a couple of DVDs and this was one of them. I saw it, it wasnt boring, but it was stupid and it was funny, I expected more from this film, but its worht watching if like comedy and Adam Sandler."
Eight Crazy Nights is the thrid back to back unfunny movie(following Little Nicky and Mr Deeds) that Adam Sandler has made in the past two years. Eight Crazy Nights is full of toiler humor and unfunny one-liners. I may have laughed once or twice if these movie. They should have called Eight Crazy Ways to ruin a comic's carrer.
"Adam Sandler is one of our favourite actors,and this is such a funny movie for all ages why would you not want it in your collection.Some may think its a bit much for children under 5,But my children 9+ loved to see Christmas cheers and a drunken fool wake up to the real world and how not everybodys life is bliss.It was a great movie to laugh, watch and learn all in one."
"8 Crazy Nights might have been a sweet film with a good message for kids, but the scatological humor, offensive language and explicit sexual references made it unsuitable for my 10-year old. The plot, on the other hand, while fine for 10-year olds was too obvious and simplistic for most of the adults in the audience. As a result, while it's probably not the worst film of the year, it is certainly in the running."
"In two of the episodes, the word ""shut up"" is used. My son is three years old and instantly picked up on it, repeated it, and told me it was a bad word, but that James and Duck (the trains) had said it. I would stay away from this one, especially if you have young, impressionable youngsters. I gave it one star, since the wooden dragon train came with it."
"""Spinout"" (1966) represents the nadir of Elvis Cinema - a bad sitcom without the laugh track. The only redeeming features are a few memorable songs, such as ""I'll Be Back"" and ""Stop, Look and Listen."" Buy the soundtrack and skip the movie."
"This is not Presley's best vehicle but by this outing he was not being allowed to act anyway so he appears to be just going though the motions. The movie songs are not a real treat either, he seems to be singing to everyone including his enemies. (Where does the music come from when he sings anyway). When asked to do this movie Presley should have ""JUST SAID NO""!!!"
"I love this desk! In fact, I have two! One for my daughter and one for my son. They are beautiful, flawless and go together easily. They are sturdy and should last a many years. So happy with this purchase!"
This one makes too small and too fine a grind of pepper to be useful in cooking. You'll be cranking away on this thing for ten minutes before you get enough crushed pepper to flavor anything.
"I am satisfied with this product. I can stick it to the fridge (it's magnetic) and have it readily available while I'm cooking. The plastic looks a little flimsy, but I think it's good value for the money."
"I have only read the first 44 pages of this book, so I'd need to read the rest. So far, though, it is interesting but seems fuzzy. The writer makes a lot of claims but I was rarely sure if they were proven or just speculation. This is the kind of sentence that makes me queasy:""Given all the activations happening at once [in the brain], physical performance probably uses 100 precent of the brain"" (p. 39).Probably? Why? Does any one activity use 100 percent of the brain? And if physical performance does, why is that important?"
I have heard Jensen speak at workshops and wanted to follow up his presentation by reading one of the books he mentioned.
"I purchased this book to refresh my professional development. The ""latest trend"" these days in education seems to be shifting to BBL (brain-based learning), so I wanted to update myself.I flipped through it first and saw that there is a lot of diagrams, figures, the text is easy to read, and understand.I haven't read through the entire book, but so far I can tell that this will be a useful reference or resource."
"They refunded the book without notifying me of this, so I was left book-less by the beginning of the term. :("
This is a very nice lunchbox with beautiful colors and images. It is made of durable and washable material. And one great thing about it is that it is different as it does not have any common TV character on it.
"I fell in love with El Cielo, which was in fact my first forray into the musical world of Dredg. El Cielo is an amazing album that follows a concept of sleep paralysis. Then I found Leitmotif, which neither moved me nor gets much spins in my cd player. Then I found Catch Without arms, which nether dazzled me nor wowed me at all. There are a few good tracks, but other than that, this album follows standard rock formula. I understand that die hard fans of Dredg will eat this album up and beg for more, but what really drew me to El Cielo was the concept album aspect and the off beat musicianship, both of which are missing from Catch without arms. Though standard, Catch without arms is decent, not a must have, but decent."
"Right now dredg is my favorite band. I absolutely think Catch Without Arms is one of the best albums of all time, I can listen to this over and over and have been. I like this album better than El Cielo. I can 1-repeat Zebraskin all day, that song can transport you out of a funk any day!"
"While this album certainly isn't the same music Heart was known for in the 70s, it brought them back into the music spotlight and brought new fans. Some people who like to act self important wanna call this type of change ""selling out"", but look at all the other bands of the past who refused to change - most of them are nowhere and forgotten. Very few bands of that era have a sound that maintains through time. Put ""bands of the 70s"" in your search browser and see what comes up. There's maybe 5 bands on that list that continued to produce music successfully thru the 80s and 90s. And Heart is one of them. When it comes to entertainment, if you wanna survive, you gotta give the fans what they want. And that's what Heart did on this disc and a few more after this."
"This is one of the greatest swing albums of all time. I'm not exactly sure who played what parts (someone said that the channel credits were reversed), but Ellis and Robillard both sound great. They seem to have a bottomless well of creative and melodic swing phrases that they can throw around at will. This album will put you in a good mood quick. Make sure to check out the sequel album too - it's just as good."
"The entire Charlie Brown series are wonderful, just purchased this one for my grandson. Would recommend as gifts for friends and family."
It was a gift for my dad and he loved it. One of his favorite holiday movies. Which he always seems to miss each year. Now he will have it always.
"The original Christmas special is good, but you're mostly paying for another ninety minutes of subpar stuff. Flashbeagle is an abomination. I would have paid half for a quarter of the cartoons in here.If you can get the DVD instead of the Amazon Video version cheaper, do it."
This is a timeless Christmas classic that still brings a lump to your throat. The music from this special is wonderful as well. A classic!
"Every year I think we get going too quickly and make an impulse buy that's foolish. This was our purchase this year. Thankfully we got a 50% credit for making the purchase (not sure what promotion it was since I didn't see it) and we got $1 toward Amazon MP3s. So our foolishness was credited, but before you buy this always remember that it airs on tv every year (in our case 3 days after we purchased it). If we had checked our TV guide we would have seen it and been able to record it for free. Buyer beware.Don't buy it."
"Some reviewers here have complained that the pillow flattens too easily. Note that according to the web site sitincomfort (The Comfort Store), there are two kinds of Comfort U pillows: one is stuffed with Fusion Fiberfill, and the other is stuffed with Fossfill. The Fusion Fiberfill is what's being sold on this Amazon page. Read carefully; other Amazon sellers stock the Fossfill version.This is an important point to consider, depending on your priorities. My understanding is that the Fusion Fiberfill is supposed to feel more like a real down pillow--which means it's likely to need to be fluffed more, too. Tricky with such a big pillow.So I recomend doing a little research and checking out the Fossfill version. The Fossfill version is allegedly better at maintaining its shape, and also lets air circulate better so it's not as hot."
