"This children's book is a collection of nineteen folk tales collected and retold by the author from his travels throughout Central and South America. The book won the 1925 Newbery Medal for best contribution to American children's literature. I am oviously in the minority with my opinion: I only awarded the book two stars. I simply found it boring. But, this is obviously a good resource of South American folktales. Perhaps those who enjoy such material will like the book more than I."
"I have the nude version of this chincher in small.I favour a vintage pinup look every day so the small waist is a main focus. I do have vintage styled cinchers and other authentic shapewear but they are expensive. This is a perfect substitute for day to day wear.As said in annother review you cannot wear this under clingy slinky clothes as it does ripple up at the front.I would recomend wearing a slip under it to avoid skin irritation. I wear a corset liner available from waist training specialists.The length is fine on me, going from just below the bra line down to the hip bones (I am 5ft 4)The cinching effect takes about 1.5 - 2 inches off my waist comfortably, enough to get into my vintage dior.I do not wear it enough to comment on the claims of permenant inch loss...but I think I will give it a try."
"I am 5'6"", but I have a long torso. That resulted in a 2"" section of skin/fat that was squeezed out of the bottom of this thing. I ordered their vest to see if it would be a better fit for me. 4-stars though, because it did actually work, and appeared to have sturdy construction. It was a bit constricting at first, and it definitely felt good to take it off at the end of the night and breathe deeply--but it helped me look much better in a tight-fitting cocktail dress than I looked alone or with spanx!"
"I ordered two different styles of the Squeem but the sizing is inconsistent. You may wear one size in one product and a total different size in the other even though it is fitting the same body part. Strange. Also, the edges of the product rubs against my skin and leaves bruises. I look like I got in a fight with a Tiger and lost."
"I was very skeptical about this. When I do wear it,it does work. It takes some getting used to."
"After 3 c sections, I need all the help I can get. I started with the size Large (when I was a size 12). I have moved on to the medium (I am between 8-10 now). The medium is REALLY tight, but does the job. I prefer the large day to day because I have 3 children under 6 to run after, and it is a bit more comfortable for that. These things are really great. I can't believe I didn't know about them after my first 2 c sections. They should send all women home with them after giving birth!"
Took off a few inches of my waist and kept it there! A bit tough to get used to so I recommend using a tank top under the squeem.
"I've been wearing my squeem off/on for about 2-3 weeks. I haven't noticed a change in my waist size but when I have it on, I look really good. It gives me that nice curve that I usually don't have. I've not given up hope on it yet."
"The package says it goes from lower belly to just under bust. I am a short woman and it doesn't reach my ribs leaving me with two huge rolls of fat on the front and back. It takes me in great, love that about it but because it isn't long enough I can't wear it anywhere:("
"I purchased this product for postpartum compression, and I only found it to be okay. The sizing puzzled me as I seemed to fit into 3 different sizes - XS for dress size, M for actual measurement, and S is right there in the middle. I ended up with the medium which fits but I think I should have purchased the small. I also purchased the belly bandit, and for postpartum compression I would much prefer that product. I do agree that the squeem makes for a good shape and it is comfortable to wear."
"I went by the Squeem chart and my waist measurements to find the correct size but to my suprise the waist cincher did not fit. Warning, you cannot return for a refund; only merchandise credit/exchange. Also, the cincher smelled like burnt rubber. Very bulky and will be visible through clothing so you cannot wear with tight fitting clothing."
"I bought this to slim down my tummy under a bridesmaid dress. First, it smelled horrific and still stunk like rubber after washing. Second, it did almost nothing to slim me down, even though I bought the suggested size. Third, after about a half hour of wearing it, it was absorbing sweat and making me feel clammy and uncomfortable. It was extremely uncomfortable to sit down in, and the boning showed through the relatively thick cotton of the dress. I abandoned it completely and felt much better."
"This product sucks!It doesn't completely suck... the 2 days I was able to wear it before the boning snapped in half it did compress pretty tight. As many people have noted, it is HELL to get into this the first time.I liked that this wasn't a body suit and the rubber on the outside would keep my shirt from sliding up.BUTThis garment:1) Rides up- if you move a lot it will eventually slide up your waist2) Leaves a huge crease on the skin above your waist-- and it hurts3) Makes you look like a sausage when you sit down: visually divides your belly in half when you sitAs I said I only wore this twice, first time I wore it for about half hour and the second time I had worn it for several hours when the boning snapped in half and was poking into my side (ouch!! )RETURNING THIS!!!"
"When I ordered this I thought it would allow me to wear some clothes that I haven't been able to do in a while because of my weight gain.I am a woman who has size 40D in breasts so I wear a large in tops and I wear a size 8 in pants, and weight 140lbs. It is suppose to clinch your waist and give you a nice looking figure. Well, it did hug my waist, but it also gave my a muffin top. Not a shape a woman wants to have. I looked better without wearing it. It folds into your folds creating a bigger fold at the top of your body. I would say this item is more for the extremely skinny female who has small breasts', no hips, or ass. Not for a woman who has large breast, hips, and ass. Not for women who are going through post-pregnancy either. For a product thats is suppose to make you feel good about yourself, it failed."
"This product is OK. The ideal behind it is great, but in my case it needs to be longer I think. I'm not tall about 5'6"" & weight about 155. After I get it on there is a roll between the bottom of my bra and the top of the waist cincher. It would be alright if your shirt isn't very snug, but isn't that the whole purpose of the waist cincher, to be able to wear jeans, shirts & dresses that are a little close fitting. It does help with the hang over with the lower cut jeans. Its just hard to wear a tight fitting shirt with them. Other than that it works pretty good. Would like to try the squeem vest to eliminate the roll between bra & waist cincher."
"I like this product. I suffer from chronic love handles especially when I wear jeans. I am 5'1"" and 122 pounds. I bought a medium because I tried my friend's small and it was way too tight for me. The medium fits well. It does get a bit hot. I love the way it hides my love handles."
"The squeem is a great idea but the construction is not the best. While the product compresses your stomach, the inner metal spines bend and then protrude at the ends. I have had to sew the ends repeatedly but the spines keep poking through. At one point, the spine developed some sort of crack and when it poked through the bottom, it scraped my stomach and I took it off immediately. I have never washed the product in the washing machine...I have always handwashed it. So, the manufacturer can't say that I didn't take good care of it."
"I only just started wearing this today but already I know I'm going to be wearing it daily, and without discomfort. I'm 6 weeks postpartum and really needed something to help me shrink back down to my former size and I do believe this WILL do the trick.So far, the hype is true. It doesn't roll down on the edges and it really evens out the figure very nicely - even under clothes you can't tell you are wearing this. I guess a con would be that I can see how you'd get sweaty wearing this all day long and especially in hot weather.Overall, I am impressed so far."
This item is very sturdy and holds in the belly area better than another softer belt I have. The measurements seem true to size and there are two rows of hooks so you can adjust if you lose some weight.The only negative points are that the item smells badly of rubber when new. It must be washed before wearing. The other is that all that rubber can make you sweat. But those are minor complaints if you want to look good for an evening. The belt also helps me sit straight so I think it's good for the back as well as the front.
I bought this product because it promised to help improve bad posture and it does. Even when I am not wearing it I find myself sitting more erect than I used to. I love it!
"the first day,( 8 hours wearing it ) it hurt me so bad , my skin was torned, itched, swell, deep red. I tried to wear other side, after few hours, I got deep burned both on the right and left belly, the skin was torned, swell, bleeding, lot of cross cut on the skin, itched for a week until now. It looked like I was beaten up or have skin disease...I am scared to dead when I look at it now. I don't know why I got it , I used something like this before, but I didn't get any bad thing. or the rubber hurt me ?"
My wife loves it but we unfortunately perchaced the wrong size. She made a coment about the sizing chart being in dress sizes and she picked the size she is and we received it and the apparel was way too small. We have been meaning to exchange it but its tough to get time being as we have new born twins. That's why she wanted the apparel. She was really excited to receive the part and was disappointed when it didn't fit.
"I went back and forth over whether or not I should purchase a small or a medium. My waist measured at 30"" just right there on the cusp. I ended up ordering the small and had the hardest time getting the booger on! And oh man UNCOMFORTABLE! Yes, it cinched my waist, but the areas that weren't inside the squeem bulged out grossly e.g. above the squeem, had a nice fat roll below my bra, not attractive and could not be hidden. I looked like a nightmare in clothes. I also didn't like that it didn't cinch my hips, meaning my pants didn't fit any better. It did make my waist tiny and gave me an hourglass figure, which I have never had before. In the long run it's getting returned. It just didn't give me the silhouette I wanted, and I don't think any amount of wearing it is going to do that."
"This product was not what I expected so I returned it. Too tight, sizing was misleading. I'll stick with my Spanx."
"This is a very heavy cotton, almost too thick. It is strpped blue just like the picture. I was thinking the picure was just another style and the one ordered would be poka dots since that is the title. I have a little girl so the blue stipes don't go. You are ordering the exact picture above so no dots!!"
The picture looks like a burnt warm orange but these are Bright orange. I really don't like the color but too much trouble to return.
wish the product description had included where it was made. it was made in china. it is a well made product.
This movie was horrible. It did not play right when I was watching it online. I liked how it went by old vampire styles. Such as crosses worked and you had to invite them in and such. But the ending was really bad. Do not waste your money on this one. Also the storyline did not really make much sense.
"This is a good puzzle-but you have to put the pieces in correctly or they don't fit well. I work with kids who have autism and this frustrates them sometimes. Otherwise, it is very durable and I use it a lot."
"Rhapsody in blue is a cool song, i guess. i'm listening to the song right now for the first time. it's cool. ,e sp driml"
"Edge of Danger is a step above a number of recent Jack Higgins tales. The protaginist - Sean Dillon, must track down a dangerous Middle Eastern billionaire before he can reek havoc on the world. While prior to 11 September, this book is relevant to our crisis. Higgins does a nice job bringing out more dimensions of Dillon and some of the other good guys. The author bumbles a chance to knock off a key character - losing the opportunity to add some tension and passion to the survivors. Incredibly, this person takes three bullets and lives. The plot is solid and fast paced. My only problem is with the enemies. They are too cold and their motives are weak. The key assaisin could audition for the Key Stone Cops. Don't get me wrong, the Edge of Danger is a good yarn. I hope Higgins continues to improve the depth and reality of his characters. I look forward to the next edition."
"This is my very first book review. Because this book is so fundamentally wrong I need to speak up. The main character Sean Dillion, formal IRA, has a license to kill and make the killing like a game rather than justice. He does whatever he wants to do without follow orders nor has any boundary. He pickup a couple of his terrorism/criminal partners making killing like a habits, terrorism competition, fun game and egoism fulfillment. It so far from any common sense such as the British General could not control this maniacal killer and let he kills who he wish to kill or threaten his masculinity. The killings like a joke to him and have absolutely no legal consequence. This book has promote violence behavior has no artist nor entertainment value. I lost my interest in Jack Higgins Sean Dillion's serial after finishing this ridicules book."
I was a big fan of Jack Higgins adventures until this book! I think this book reads like a poorly written condensed version of a good story - or like the outline of a book. It jumped around too abruptly with poorly written dialogue - no conversation was stretched into a normal length of exchange between people. It was difficult to keep track of all the minor characters in the book because none of them were well developed. I will proabably never read another Jack Higgins book. I am very disappointed - just like I got with Robert Ludlum in one of his later novels. I have never read another book of his either.
"Look. I can't really disagree with the other reviews. However, I enjoyed this book. If you, as have I, read every Sean Dillon book in the series you will enjoy spending a few hours with these characters who have become so familiar after so many years. Great literature? Not a chance. A good read for fans of Jack Higgins? Definitely!!!!"
It's got a nice warm scent of vanilla-like smell. Texture is creamy. Meadow Sweet is a nice nude color. Can't apply too much or else it'll look a bit dry.
Only has limited access to OBDII data stream unless you pay more money to upgrade the software.
Written in old English. It was very hard to read as I had to think through most sentences to figure out what was being said.
